# Testing Checklist - October 6, 2025

**Deployment:** https://frontend-two-swart-31.vercel.app  
**Last Update:** October 6, 2025, 11:52

## ✅ What Was Fixed Today

### 1. Missing API Endpoint: `/api/admin/orders`
**Status:** ✅ Created and deployed

**File:** `frontend/api/admin/orders.ts`

**Features:**
- GET - List all orders with pagination
- POST - Create new order
- PUT/PATCH - Update order
- DELETE - Delete order
- Admin authentication required
- Filters: status, courier_id, merchant_id, search
- Joins with courier and merchant data

**Used By:** `ReviewBuilder.tsx` (line 77)

## 🔍 Understanding Hash Routing

### Why URLs Have `#`
Your app uses **HashRouter** (not BrowserRouter), which is why URLs look like:
- `https://frontend-two-swart-31.vercel.app/#/trustscores`
- `https://frontend-two-swart-31.vercel.app/#/dashboard`

**This is CORRECT and intentional!**

### Hash vs Browser Routing

**HashRouter (Current):**
- ✅ Works on all servers without configuration
- ✅ No 404 errors on page refresh
- ✅ Simpler deployment
- ❌ URLs have `#` symbol

**BrowserRouter (Alternative):**
- ✅ Clean URLs without `#`
- ❌ Requires server configuration
- ❌ Can cause 404 on refresh if not configured

**Recommendation:** Keep HashRouter for now - it's working correctly!

## 🧪 Test Plan

### Test 1: Login & Dashboard
1. Go to https://frontend-two-swart-31.vercel.app
2. Login with admin credentials
3. ✅ Should redirect to `/#/dashboard`
4. ✅ Dashboard should load without errors

### Test 2: Admin Orders API
1. Navigate to Review Builder page
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. ✅ Should see successful API call to `/api/admin/orders`
4. ✅ No 404 errors for `/api/admin/orders`

### Test 3: TrustScores Page
1. Click "Trust Scores" in navigation
2. ✅ Should navigate to `/#/trustscores`
3. ✅ Page should load courier data
4. ✅ No console errors

### Test 4: Check Console Logs
**Expected (Good):**
```
✅ [AuthStore] Login successful
✅ [NotificationSystem] Connecting to Pusher
✅ Dashboard v2.0 - All array fixes applied!
✅ API calls returning 200 OK
```

**Not Expected (Bad):**
```
❌ 404 errors for /api/admin/orders
❌ 404 errors for /api/trustscore
❌ Authentication errors
```

## 📊 Current Status

### API Endpoints
- ✅ `/api/auth` - Authentication (working)
- ✅ `/api/admin/orders` - Admin orders (JUST FIXED)
- ✅ `/api/trustscore` - TrustScore data (exists)
- ✅ `/api/orders` - Regular orders (exists)
- ✅ `/api/couriers` - Couriers (exists)

### Pages
- ✅ `/` - Login page
- ✅ `/#/dashboard` - Dashboard
- ✅ `/#/trustscores` - TrustScores
- ✅ `/#/orders` - Orders
- ✅ `/#/analytics` - Analytics

---

## 🐛 Known Issues (From Yesterday)

### Issue 1: `/api/admin/orders` - 404
**Status:** ✅ FIXED (endpoint created)

### Issue 2: `/login#/trustscores` - 404
**Status:** ⚠️ NEEDS INVESTIGATION

**Analysis:**
- The URL `/login#/trustscores` is malformed
- Should be either `/login` OR `/#/trustscores`
- Likely a redirect issue after login
- May be fixed now that admin/orders endpoint exists

**Action:** Test login flow and check if this still occurs

## 🎯 Next Steps After Testing

### If Tests Pass ✅
Move to critical Week 1 tasks:
1. Sentry error tracking (2h)
2. Email templates (4h)
3. PostHog analytics (2h)

### If Tests Fail ❌
1. Check Vercel deployment logs
2. Check browser console for specific errors
3. Verify environment variables in Vercel
4. Check database connection

---

## 🔧 Debugging Commands

### Check Vercel Deployment
```bash
# Check latest deployment
vercel ls

# View deployment logs
vercel logs <deployment-url>
```

### Check API Endpoints Locally
```bash
# Start dev server
cd frontend
npm run dev

# Test API endpoint
curl http://localhost:5173/api/admin/orders \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### Check Browser Console
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for:
   - Red errors (❌)
   - Network 404s
   - Authentication issues
