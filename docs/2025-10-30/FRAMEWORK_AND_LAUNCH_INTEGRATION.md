# FRAMEWORK AND LAUNCH PLAN INTEGRATION

**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Framework:** SPEC_DRIVEN_FRAMEWORK v1.26  
**Status:** ‚úÖ ACTIVE

---

## üéØ CORE PRINCIPLE

**ALL 29 RULES APPLY DURING THE 5-WEEK LAUNCH**

RULE #29 does NOT replace other rules. It ADDS launch tracking and scope control.

---

## üìã HOW THE RULES WORK TOGETHER

### **Rules #1-28: HOW to Build (Quality & Process)**
These rules ensure quality, prevent mistakes, and maintain standards.

**ALWAYS ENFORCED:**
- ‚úÖ Database validation before changes
- ‚úÖ No database alterations without approval
- ‚úÖ Check for duplicates before building
- ‚úÖ Reuse existing code
- ‚úÖ Follow API templates
- ‚úÖ Follow approved specs
- ‚úÖ No shortcuts or workarounds
- ‚úÖ Proper testing and documentation

### **Rule #29: WHAT to Build (Scope Control)**
This rule ensures focus on launch-critical work only.

**ADDS:**
- ‚úÖ Daily/weekly launch tracking
- ‚úÖ Scope control (no feature creep)
- ‚úÖ Launch-critical focus only
- ‚úÖ Decision framework for prioritization

---

## üîÑ DAILY WORKFLOW DURING LAUNCH

### **Every Morning:**

**1. Launch Plan Tracker (RULE #29)**
```markdown
## üìÖ LAUNCH PLAN TRACKER
- Current Date: [Date]
- Days Until Launch: [X]
- Current Week: Week [X] of 5
- On Track? ‚úÖ / ‚ö†Ô∏è / ‚ùå
```

**2. Framework Compliance Check (RULES #1-28)**
```markdown
## ‚úÖ FRAMEWORK COMPLIANCE CHECK
- [ ] Database validation (RULE #1)
- [ ] No database changes (RULE #2)
- [ ] Check for duplicates (RULE #23)
- [ ] Reuse existing code (RULE #24)
- [ ] Follow API template (RULE #5)
- [ ] Follow approved spec (RULE #6)
```

**3. Launch Focus Check (RULE #29)**
```markdown
## üéØ LAUNCH FOCUS CHECK
1. Does this help us launch on Dec 9?
2. Is this blocking the launch?
3. Can we launch without this?
```

---

## üìä EXAMPLE: FIXING A BUG

### **Scenario: ORDER-TRENDS API returns empty data**

**Step 1: Launch Focus Check (RULE #29)**
- ‚ùì Does this help us launch? ‚Üí ‚úÖ YES (blocking issue)
- ‚ùì Is this blocking? ‚Üí ‚úÖ YES (critical API)
- ‚ùì Can we launch without it? ‚Üí ‚ùå NO
- **Decision:** HIGH PRIORITY - Proceed

**Step 2: Database Validation (RULE #1)**
```sql
-- Check existing tables
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_name LIKE '%order%' OR table_name LIKE '%trend%';

-- Check columns
SELECT table_name, column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name IN ('orders', 'order_items', 'analytics');
```

**Step 3: Check for Duplicates (RULE #23)**
```bash
# Search for existing implementations
grep -r "order.*trend" api/
grep -r "ORDER.*TREND" apps/web/src/
find . -name "*trend*" -o -name "*analytics*"
```

**Step 4: Reuse Existing Code (RULE #24)**
- Found: `orders` table has all needed data
- Found: `/api/analytics/` has similar queries
- **Decision:** Reuse existing table and query pattern

**Step 5: Follow API Template (RULE #5)**
```typescript
// Use current production template
export default async function handler(
  req: NextApiRequest,
  res: NextApiResponse
) {
  // Validation
  // Query
  // Response
}
```

**Step 6: Implement Fix**
- No new tables (RULE #2)
- Reused existing schema (RULE #3)
- Followed template (RULE #5)
- Added tests (RULE #7)
- Documented (RULE #10)

**Step 7: Verify Launch Impact (RULE #29)**
- ‚úÖ Blocking issue resolved
- ‚úÖ Launch can proceed
- ‚úÖ No scope creep
- ‚úÖ On track for Dec 9

---

## üìä EXAMPLE: FEATURE REQUEST

### **Scenario: "Can we add TMS courier profiles?"**

**Step 1: Launch Focus Check (RULE #29)**
- ‚ùì Does this help us launch? ‚Üí ‚ùå NO (not in MVP)
- ‚ùì Is this blocking? ‚Üí ‚ùå NO
- ‚ùì Can we launch without it? ‚Üí ‚úÖ YES
- **Decision:** DEFER to Phase 3 (Weeks 13-26)

**No further steps needed - request rejected per RULE #29**

**Explanation to stakeholder:**
> "TMS courier profiles are planned for Phase 3 (Weeks 13-26) after we validate the MVP with real customers. Adding this now would delay our Dec 9 launch by 3+ weeks and cost $20k. Let's launch first, gather feedback, then build TMS based on actual customer needs."

---

## üìä EXAMPLE: POLISH REQUEST

### **Scenario: "Can we improve the checkout UX?"**

**Step 1: Launch Focus Check (RULE #29)**
- ‚ùì Does this help us launch? ‚Üí ‚úÖ YES (Week 2 objective)
- ‚ùì Is this blocking? ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è Not blocking, but important
- ‚ùì Can we launch without it? ‚Üí ‚úÖ YES, but better with it
- **Decision:** INCLUDE in Week 2 (Polish & Optimize)

**Step 2: Check for Duplicates (RULE #23)**
```bash
# Search for existing checkout code
find apps/web/src/ -name "*checkout*"
grep -r "checkout" apps/web/src/components/
```

**Step 3: Reuse Existing Code (RULE #24)**
- Found: Checkout component exists
- Found: Payment flow works
- **Decision:** Polish existing, don't rebuild

**Step 4: Implement Polish**
- No new components (reuse existing)
- No database changes
- CSS/UX improvements only
- Follow existing patterns

**Step 5: Verify Launch Impact (RULE #29)**
- ‚úÖ Improves launch quality
- ‚úÖ Scheduled for Week 2
- ‚úÖ No scope creep
- ‚úÖ On track for Dec 9

## ‚ö†Ô∏è COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### **Mistake #1: "RULE #29 means we can skip validation"**
‚ùå **WRONG!**
- RULE #29 controls WHAT to build
- RULE #1 controls HOW to build
- BOTH apply!

‚úÖ **CORRECT:**
- Validate database (RULE #1)
- Check if launch-critical (RULE #29)
- If yes to both ‚Üí Proceed with quality

### **Mistake #2: "It's launch-critical, so I can skip checks"**
‚ùå **WRONG!**
- Launch-critical = high priority
- High priority ‚â† skip quality checks
- Fast ‚â† sloppy

‚úÖ **CORRECT:**
- Launch-critical = do it NOW
- But still follow all quality rules
- Fast AND high-quality

### **Mistake #3: "I checked for duplicates once this week"**
‚ùå **WRONG!**
- Check EVERY time before building
- Database changes daily
- Code changes daily

‚úÖ **CORRECT:**
- Check before EACH new feature
- Check before EACH new API
- Check before EACH new component

### **Mistake #4: "This is a small change, no need for spec"**
‚ùå **WRONG!**
- RULE #6: All changes need spec
- Size doesn't matter
- Process matters

‚úÖ **CORRECT:**
- Small change = small spec
- But still document it
- Still get approval
