# ✅ Test Users Setup - Complete Guide

**Date:** October 23, 2025, 10:55 AM  
**Status:** 🟢 Ready to Use  
**Methods:** 2 options (Playwright recommended, SQL fallback)

---

## 🎯 Two Methods Available

### Method 1: Playwright (Recommended! ⭐)
**Creates users via signup flow**

✅ **Advantages:**
- Tests your auth system
- Fully automated
- Reusable auth sessions (3-5 min faster)
- CI/CD ready
- No database access needed

### Method 2: SQL (Fallback)
**Creates users directly in database**

✅ **Advantages:**
- Always works
- Creates complete test data
- Includes orders, reviews, TrustScore
- Good for database testing

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option A: Playwright (Automated Script)

```bash
# Run automated setup
.\scripts\setup-test-users.ps1
```

**Or manually:**
```bash
# 1. Create users
npm run test:setup

# 2. Create auth sessions
npm run test:setup:auth

# 3. Run tests
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

### Option B: SQL (Manual)

1. Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Copy contents of: `database/CREATE_PLAYWRIGHT_TEST_USERS.sql`
3. Paste and click **RUN** ▶️
4. Run tests: `npm run test:e2e:ui`

## 🎯 Which Method Should I Use?

### Use Playwright if:
- ✅ Your signup flow works
- ✅ You want automated setup
- ✅ You want faster tests (reusable sessions)
- ✅ You're setting up CI/CD
- ✅ You don't have database access

### Use SQL if:
- ✅ Signup flow is broken
- ✅ Email verification is required
- ✅ You need complete test data
- ✅ You're doing database testing
- ✅ You have Supabase access

**Recommendation:** Try Playwright first, use SQL as fallback if needed.

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Playwright Method

**Issue: "User already exists"**
```bash
# Skip to auth setup
npm run test:setup:auth
```

**Issue: "Cannot find signup page"**
```bash
# Check BASE_URL
BASE_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app npm run test:setup
```

**Issue: "Email verification required"**
```bash
# Use SQL fallback
# Run: database/CREATE_PLAYWRIGHT_TEST_USERS.sql in Supabase
```

### SQL Method

**Issue: "pgcrypto extension not found"**
```sql
-- Run this first
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgcrypto;
```

**Issue: "Users already exist"**
```
✅ This is fine! Script auto-deletes old users.
Just run it again.
```

## 🎭 Performance Comparison

### Playwright with Auth Sessions:
```
Setup time: 30 seconds (one-time)
Test run time: 2-3 minutes (282 tests)
Login overhead: 0 seconds (reusable sessions)

Total: ~3 minutes per run
```

### SQL without Auth Sessions:
```
Setup time: 2 minutes (manual)
Test run time: 7-8 minutes (282 tests)
Login overhead: 5 minutes (login each test)

Total: ~8 minutes per run
```

**Savings with Playwright: 5 minutes per test run! 🚀**

## 🎉 Success Checklist

### Playwright Method:
- [ ] Run: `.\scripts\setup-test-users.ps1`
- [ ] Verify users created (check output)
- [ ] Verify auth sessions (check `.auth/` folder)
- [ ] Run: `npm run test:e2e:ui`
- [ ] Check results (expect 50-100 passing)
- [ ] View report: `npm run test:e2e:report`

### SQL Method:
- [ ] Open Supabase SQL Editor
- [ ] Copy `CREATE_PLAYWRIGHT_TEST_USERS.sql`
- [ ] Paste and run
- [ ] Verify success message
- [ ] Run: `npm run test:e2e:ui`
- [ ] Check results (expect 50-100 passing)

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Use UI Mode
```bash
npm run test:e2e:ui
```
Watch tests run visually and debug failures easily.

### Tip 2: Run Setup Once
Auth sessions are reusable! Only recreate if login flow changes.

### Tip 3: Combine Both Methods
```bash
# Use SQL for complete data
# Run: CREATE_PLAYWRIGHT_TEST_USERS.sql in Supabase

# Then create auth sessions
npm run test:setup:auth

# Best of both worlds! 🎉
```

### Tip 4: Check Auth Files
```bash
# View saved session
cat tests/e2e/.auth/merchant.json
```

---

## 🚀 Ready to Go!

### Recommended Workflow:

**First Time:**
```bash
# Try Playwright first
.\scripts\setup-test-users.ps1

# If that fails, use SQL fallback
# Run: database/CREATE_PLAYWRIGHT_TEST_USERS.sql
```

**Then Run Tests:**
```bash
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

**Expected:** ~50-100 tests passing (up from 6)! 🎉
