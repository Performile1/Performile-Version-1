## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Use UI Mode
```bash
npm run test:e2e:ui
```
This lets you see tests run visually and debug failures easily.

### Tip 2: Run Single Test
```bash
npx playwright test -g "should login merchant"
```
Test specific functionality without running all 282 tests.

### Tip 3: Check Screenshots
Failed tests automatically capture screenshots in:
```
playwright-report/
```

### Tip 4: Watch Mode
```bash
npx playwright test --ui
```
Tests re-run automatically when you save files.
