## üìÖ ROADMAP OVERVIEW

### Current Status: **97% Complete** - Production Ready
### Focus: Polish ‚Üí Enhance ‚Üí Scale

---

## üöÄ IMMEDIATE PRIORITY (Next 1-2 Days)

**Goal:** 100% Production-Ready Platform with Proper Role Separation

### üî¥ CRITICAL: Role-Based Data Filtering (SECURITY)
**Estimated Time:** 16-20 hours  
**Priority:** üî¥ CRITICAL - Security Issue  
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKING PRODUCTION

**Problem Identified:** Dashboard, Analytics, and Orders pages currently show platform-wide data to ALL users instead of role-specific data. This is a critical security and privacy issue.

#### Phase 1: Backend API Separation (8-10 hours)
- [ ] **Create Role-Specific Dashboard Endpoints**
  - [ ] Create `/api/merchant/dashboard` - Returns only merchant's shops, orders, revenue
  - [ ] Create `/api/courier/dashboard` - Returns only courier's deliveries, performance
  - [ ] Create `/api/consumer/dashboard` - Returns only consumer's orders
  - [ ] Update `/api/admin/dashboard` - Keep platform-wide access
  - **Files:** `api/merchant/dashboard.ts`, `api/courier/dashboard.ts`, `api/consumer/dashboard.ts`
  - **Reference:** `docs/ROLE_FILTERING_IMPLEMENTATION.md` (complete code examples provided)

- [ ] **Create Role-Specific Analytics Endpoints**
  - [ ] Create `/api/merchant/analytics` - Own shops' analytics only
  - [ ] Create `/api/courier/analytics` - Own performance analytics only
  - [ ] Fix `/api/admin/analytics` - Currently used by all roles (WRONG)
  - **Files:** `api/merchant/analytics.ts`, `api/courier/analytics.ts`

- [ ] **Add Ownership Filtering to Orders API**
  - [ ] Filter by `shop_id IN (user's shops)` for merchants
  - [ ] Filter by `courier_id = user_id` for couriers
  - [ ] Filter by `consumer_id = user_id` for consumers
  - [ ] No filter for admins (see all)
  - **File:** `api/orders/index.ts`

- [ ] **Add Ownership Filtering to Team Management**
  - [ ] Filter by `merchant_id` or `courier_id`
  - [ ] Validate ownership on all CRUD operations
  - **File:** `api/team/index.ts`

- [ ] **Add Ownership Filtering to Claims**
  - [ ] Filter by order ownership
  - [ ] Validate user can access claim
  - **File:** `api/claims/index.ts`

#### Phase 2: Frontend Updates (4-6 hours)
- [ ] **Update Dashboard.tsx**
  - [ ] Replace `/trustscore/dashboard` with role-specific endpoints
  - [ ] Add role-based component rendering
  - [ ] Create `MerchantDashboard`, `CourierDashboard`, `ConsumerDashboard` components
  - [ ] Test with each role
  - **File:** `pages/Dashboard.tsx`

- [ ] **Update Analytics.tsx**
  - [ ] Replace admin-only endpoint with role-specific endpoints
  - [ ] Add subscription-based feature gating
  - [ ] Test with each role
  - **File:** `pages/Analytics.tsx`

- [ ] **Update Orders.tsx**
  - [ ] Ensure using filtered endpoint
  - [ ] Add role-based action buttons
  - [ ] Test with each role
  - **File:** `pages/Orders.tsx`

#### Phase 3: Database Security (2-4 hours)
- [ ] **Implement Row Level Security (RLS)**
  - [ ] Enable RLS on `orders` table
  - [ ] Enable RLS on `shops` table
  - [ ] Enable RLS on `team_members` table
  - [ ] Create role-based policies
  - [ ] Create helper functions (`current_user_id()`, `current_user_role()`)
  - **Reference:** `docs/ROLE_FILTERING_IMPLEMENTATION.md` (SQL examples provided)

#### Phase 4: Testing & Validation (2-4 hours)
- [ ] **Test Data Isolation**
  - [ ] Test Merchant A cannot see Merchant B's data
  - [ ] Test Courier A cannot see Courier B's data
  - [ ] Test Consumer A cannot see Consumer B's data
  - [ ] Test Admin can see all data
  - [ ] Test subscription limits are enforced

- [ ] **Security Audit**
  - [ ] Verify all endpoints validate role
  - [ ] Verify all queries filter by ownership
  - [ ] Test for data leakage
  - [ ] Document findings

**Documentation Created:**
- ‚úÖ `docs/VIEW_AUDIT_AND_ROLE_CONFLICTS.md` - Complete audit report (1,500+ lines)
- ‚úÖ `docs/ROLE_FILTERING_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Exact code implementations (1,200+ lines)
- ‚úÖ `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` - Quick reference guide

**Impact:**
