## 📊 **COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES**

### **1. Data-Driven TrustScore**

**Unique Algorithm:**
```
TrustScore = 
  (Customer Reviews × 30%) +        // With non-response scoring
  (Completion Rate × 25%) +         // Fair in-transit logic
  (On-Time Delivery × 20%) +
  (First-Attempt Success × 15%) +
  (Low Claim Rate × 10%)
```

**Key Innovation:** Non-response = 75% satisfaction
- Most platforms only count submitted reviews (biased)
- We track all review requests and count non-responses
- More accurate, fair scoring

**Postal Code-Specific:**
- Same courier performs differently in different areas
- We show performance for YOUR postal code
- More relevant, actionable data

---

### **2. Predictive Delivery Estimates**

**Day-Based Predictions:**
- Uses historical delivery data
- Removes statistical outliers
- Applies recency weighting
- Shows confidence intervals

**Time-of-Day Predictions:**
- "Usually delivered between 14:00-17:00"
- Based on actual tracking timestamps
- Postal code and day-of-week specific
- Only for home delivery

**Competitive Edge:** Amazon doesn't even do this at postal code level!

---

### **3. C2C Shipping with Margin**

**Unique Position:**
- Most platforms: Merchant pays courier directly (no margin)
- **Performile C2C:** We intermediate payment, keep 20-30%
- High-margin, scalable revenue stream
- Network effects (more consumers = more value)

**Features:**
- PDF labels with barcodes
- QR codes (PostNord, Bring, Budbee)
- Real-time pricing
- Multiple courier options

---

### **4. Fair TrustScore Calculation**

**Innovation:** Don't penalize for in-progress orders

**Rules:**
- ✅ Delivered → Count as success
- ❌ Failed → Count as failure
- ⏸️ In-transit (within ETA + 1 day) → Don't count yet
- ❌ In-transit (overdue 2+ days) → Count as failure

**Result:** Fair, accurate scoring (100% vs misleading 40%)
