# 🚨 PRIORITY ISSUES FOR TOMORROW - October 21, 2025

**Created:** October 20, 2025, 11:05 PM  
**Status:** To Be Fixed Tomorrow  
**Priority:** HIGH

---

## 🐛 CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND

### **Issue 1: Subscription Views Confusion** 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY

**Problem:**
- Admin can see subscriptions (working ✅)
- Both public AND logged-in views exist (redundant)
- Need to simplify the views

**Current State:**
```
📊 ADMIN VIEW
├── ✅ Can see all subscriptions
├── ✅ Has merchant/courier tabs
└── ❌ Can't save plan changes

🌐 PUBLIC VIEW (/#/subscription/plans)
├── ✅ Shows plans for non-logged-in users
├── ✅ Has merchant/courier toggle
└── ✅ "Get Started" redirects to register

👤 LOGGED-IN VIEW (for merchants/couriers)
├── ❌ Gets 404 error
├── ❌ Can't see their subscription
└── ❌ View doesn't exist or broken route
```

**Solution Needed:**
1. **For Public Users (not logged in):**
   - ✅ KEEP: Public pricing page (`/#/subscription/plans`)
   - ✅ KEEP: "Get Started" → Register flow
   - ❌ DELETE: Redundant logged-in view

2. **For Merchants/Couriers (logged in):**
   - ❌ DELETE: Public pricing page access
   - ✅ KEEP: Dashboard subscription component
   - ✅ CREATE: "My Subscription" page showing:
     - Current plan
     - Usage stats
     - Upgrade/downgrade options
     - Billing history

3. **For Admin:**
   - ✅ KEEP: Admin subscriptions page
   - ✅ FIX: Save functionality

---

### **Issue 2: 404 Error on Merchant/Courier Subscription View** 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY

**Problem:**
- Merchants and couriers get 404 when trying to view subscriptions
- Route doesn't exist or API endpoint missing

**Error Details:**
```
GET /api/subscriptions/[something] → 404 Not Found
```

**Possible Causes:**
1. Route not defined in router
2. API endpoint missing
3. Wrong URL being called
4. RLS policy blocking access

**To Investigate:**
- [ ] Check what URL is being called
- [ ] Check if route exists in router
- [ ] Check if API endpoint exists
- [ ] Check RLS policies for user_subscriptions table
- [ ] Check authentication token

**Expected Behavior:**
- Merchant logs in → Can see their subscription
- Courier logs in → Can see their subscription
- Shows: Plan name, price, usage, limits

---

### **Issue 3: Admin Can't Save Plan Changes** 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY

**Problem:**
- Admin can view subscription plans
- Admin can edit plan details
- Admin CANNOT save changes (button doesn't work or API fails)

**Possible Causes:**
1. Save button not connected to API
2. API endpoint missing (PUT/PATCH)
3. Validation errors
4. RLS policy blocking updates
5. Missing admin permissions

**To Investigate:**
- [ ] Check if save button has onClick handler
- [ ] Check what API endpoint is called
- [ ] Check if endpoint exists
- [ ] Check RLS policies for subscription_plans table
- [ ] Check admin role verification
- [ ] Check console for errors

**Expected Behavior:**
- Admin edits plan (name, price, features, etc.)
- Admin clicks "Save"
- Changes are saved to database
- Success message shown
- Plan list updates

## 📊 CURRENT STATE SUMMARY

### **What's Working ✅**

- Redundant views causing confusion
- No "My Subscription" page for logged-in users

---

## 🔍 INVESTIGATION NEEDED

### **Question 1: What URL causes the 404?**
Need to check browser console/network tab to see:

- What HTTP method? (GET, POST, PUT?)
- What's the full error response?

### **Question 2: What happens when admin clicks Save?**
Need to check:
- Does button have onClick handler?
- What API endpoint is called?
- What's the error message?
- Check browser console

### **Question 3: Where should logged-in users see subscriptions?**
Options:
- A. Dashboard widget (current plan summary)
- B. Dedicated "My Subscription" page
- C. Settings page section
- **Recommendation: B + A (page + widget)**

---

## 🛠️ TECHNICAL DETAILS

### **Database Tables Involved**

**subscription_plans:**
```sql
- subscription_plan_id (PK)
- plan_name
- plan_slug
- user_type (merchant/courier)
- tier (1-4)
- monthly_price
- annual_price
- features (JSONB)
- is_active
- is_popular
```

**user_subscriptions:**
```sql
- subscription_id (PK)
- user_id (FK)
- subscription_plan_id (FK)
- status (active/cancelled/expired)
- current_period_start
- current_period_end
- stripe_subscription_id
- orders_used_this_month
- cancel_at_period_end
```

### **RLS Policies Needed**

**For subscription_plans:**
```sql
-- Public can read active plans
CREATE POLICY "Public can view active plans"
ON subscription_plans FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (is_active = true);

-- Admin can update plans
CREATE POLICY "Admin can update plans"
ON subscription_plans FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (auth.jwt() ->> 'user_role' = 'admin');
```

**For user_subscriptions:**
```sql
-- Users can view their own subscription
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own subscription"
ON user_subscriptions FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (user_id = auth.uid());

-- Admin can view all subscriptions
CREATE POLICY "Admin can view all subscriptions"
ON user_subscriptions FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (auth.jwt() ->> 'user_role' = 'admin');
```
