# RLS Testing Summary - Oct 14, 2025

## üéØ Objective
Test and verify Row Level Security (RLS) implementation on the `orders` table.

---

## ‚úÖ What's Working

### 1. RLS is Enabled
```sql
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity FROM pg_tables WHERE tablename = 'orders';
-- Result: rowsecurity = true ‚úÖ
```

### 2. RLS Policies Exist
- `orders_select_admin` - Admin sees all orders
- `orders_select_merchant` - Merchant sees own store orders
- `orders_select_courier` - Courier sees assigned orders
- `orders_select_consumer` - Consumer sees own email orders

### 3. RLS Context is Being Set
Vercel logs show:
```
[RLS] Context set successfully
[Orders API] Query returned 10 orders
```

---

## ‚ùå Issues Found

### 1. **SQL Editor Tests are Unreliable**
**Problem:** Using `SET app.user_role = 'consumer'` in SQL Editor shows all 105 orders.

**Root Cause:** SQL Editor runs as **postgres superuser** which **bypasses RLS**.

**Solution:** ‚úÖ Ignore SQL Editor tests. Only test through the application.

---

### 2. **Admin Seeing Limited Orders** (RESOLVED)
**Initial Problem:** Admin was only seeing orders from "Demo Electronics Store".

**Current Status:** Admin now sees orders from multiple stores:
- Demo Electronics Store
- Merchant's Store
- Rickard's Store
- Fashion Boutique Demo

**Remaining Question:** Are these ALL 11 stores or just some?

**Database has 11 stores with 105 total orders:**
- Demo Store: 16 orders
- PetParadise AB: 12 orders
- BookWorld Scandinavia: 12 orders
- TechHub Stockholm: 12 orders
- GreenLife Copenhagen: 11 orders
- HomeDesign Oslo: 9 orders
- ToolPro Norway: 8 orders
- BeautyBox Nordic: 8 orders
- SportMax Sweden: 7 orders
- Nordic Fashion AB: 6 orders
- KidsCorner Denmark: 4 orders

---

### 3. **Pagination Not Working**
**Problem:** API returns 10 orders, but frontend displays 50+ orders.

**Root Cause:** Frontend is displaying cached data from previous requests.

**Evidence:**
- Vercel logs: `[Orders API] Query returned 10 orders`
- Frontend: Showing 50+ orders on page

**Solution Needed:** Clear React Query cache or fix caching strategy.

---

### 4. **Missing RLS User Log**
**Problem:** Can't see what `userId` and `role` are being passed to RLS.

**Expected Log:**
```
[Orders API] RLS User: { userId: '380d58ed-...', role: 'admin' }
```

**Actual:** Log line is missing from Vercel logs (might be filtered).

**Solution:** Need to verify the JWT token contains correct role.

---

## üîç Next Steps

### Priority 1: Verify Admin Sees ALL Orders
```sql
-- Check if admin is seeing all stores
SELECT 
  s.store_name,
  COUNT(o.order_id) as order_count
FROM orders o
JOIN stores s ON o.store_id = s.store_id
GROUP BY s.store_name
ORDER BY s.store_name;
```

**Expected:** Admin should see orders from all 11 stores.

**Action:** Count how many unique stores are visible in the admin Orders page.

---

### Priority 2: Fix Pagination
**Issue:** Frontend showing cached data.

**Solution:**
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Check if pagination works correctly

**Or:** Fix React Query caching in `Orders.tsx`.

---

### Priority 3: Test Other Roles
Once admin is confirmed working, test:

1. **Merchant with no stores** ‚Üí Should see 0 orders
   - User: `testmerchant@test.com` / `password`
   - Expected: 0 orders

2. **Consumer** ‚Üí Should see only their orders
   - User: `anna.andersson@email.se` (7 orders)
   - Expected: 7 orders

3. **Courier** ‚Üí Should see only assigned orders
   - Need to create test courier

## üìä Current Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| RLS Enabled | ‚úÖ Working | Confirmed in database |
| RLS Policies | ‚úÖ Created | 4 policies with role checks |
| RLS Context | ‚úÖ Set | Vercel logs confirm |
| Admin Policy | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Seeing multiple stores, need to verify all 11 |
| Merchant Policy | ‚ùì Untested | Created test user, couldn't login (auth bug) |
| Consumer Policy | ‚ùì Untested | Password reset failed |
| Courier Policy | ‚ùì Untested | Not tested yet |
| Pagination | ‚ùå Broken | Frontend showing cached data |
| SQL Editor Tests | ‚ùå Unreliable | Superuser bypass |

---

## üéØ Conclusion

**RLS is likely working correctly**, but we can't fully verify due to:
1. Frontend caching issues (pagination)
2. Auth system bugs (can't test other roles)
3. Missing detailed logs (can't see exact role being set)

**Recommendation:** Fix pagination first, then test all roles systematically.

---

## üìù Test Scripts Created

1. `database/FIX_RLS_POLICIES.sql` - Fixed policies with role checks
2. `database/RESET_TEST_PASSWORD.sql` - Reset test user password
3. `database/RLS_COMPREHENSIVE_TEST.sql` - Comprehensive RLS test
4. `database/RLS_TEST_SIMPLE.sql` - Simple RLS test

---

## üîß Code Changes Made

1. Added role checks to all RLS policies
2. Added detailed logging to `/api/orders` endpoint
3. Created test merchant user
