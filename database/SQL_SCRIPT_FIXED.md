# ✅ SQL Script Fixed - Ready to Run!

**Date:** October 23, 2025, 11:34 AM  
**Issue:** Column name mismatch in Orders table  
**Status:** 🟢 Fixed and ready

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Problem:
The SQL script was using incorrect column names that don't exist in your Orders table:
- ❌ `delivery_city` (doesn't exist)
- ❌ `delivery_postal_code` (should be `postal_code`)
- ❌ `delivery_country` (should be `country`)
- ❌ `customer_name` (doesn't exist)
- ❌ `customer_email` (doesn't exist)
- ❌ `customer_phone` (doesn't exist)
- ❌ `order_value` (doesn't exist)

### Solution:
Updated to use the correct column names from your actual schema:
- ✅ `tracking_number` (required field)
- ✅ `order_number`
- ✅ `delivery_address`
- ✅ `postal_code`
- ✅ `country` (defaults to 'SWE')
- ✅ `order_status`
- ✅ `order_date`
- ✅ `created_at`

---

## 📊 Your Actual Orders Table Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    tracking_number VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,  -- Required!
    store_id UUID NOT NULL,
    courier_id UUID NOT NULL,
    consumer_id UUID,
    
    -- Order details
    order_number VARCHAR(100),
    order_date TIMESTAMP,
    delivery_date TIMESTAMP,
    estimated_delivery TIMESTAMP,
    
    -- Delivery specifics
    level_of_service VARCHAR(100),
    type_of_delivery VARCHAR(100),
    postal_code VARCHAR(20),
    country VARCHAR(3) DEFAULT 'SWE',
    delivery_address TEXT,
    
    -- Status tracking
    order_status order_status DEFAULT 'pending',
    is_reviewed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    
    -- Timestamps
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```
