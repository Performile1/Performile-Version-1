# Fix Summary - October 6, 2025, 13:50

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. Build Failure - Missing @supabase/supabase-js Package
**Problem:** The `/api/admin/orders.ts` endpoint was trying to import `@supabase/supabase-js` which wasn't installed.

**Solution:** Rewrote the entire endpoint to use PostgreSQL (`pg` package) instead of Supabase client, matching the pattern used by all other API endpoints.

**Changes:**
- Replaced Supabase client with PostgreSQL Pool
- Replaced Supabase auth with JWT verification
- Rewrote all database queries to use raw SQL
- Added proper error handling

### 2. Double /api Prefix in Team API Calls
**Problem:** URLs like `/api/api/team/my-entities` were being generated.

**Solution:** Removed `/api` prefix from all team API calls in `useTeamApi.ts` since `apiClient` already adds it.

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/api/admin/orders.ts` - Complete rewrite
- `frontend/src/hooks/useTeamApi.ts` - Removed duplicate `/api` prefixes

## ✅ What Should Work Now

After the deployment completes (2-3 minutes):

1. **✅ `/api/admin/orders`** - Should return 200 OK (not 500)
2. **✅ `/api/team/my-entities`** - Should return 200 OK (not 404)
3. **✅ No build errors** - TypeScript compilation should succeed
4. **✅ No missing package errors** - All dependencies exist

---

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Wait for Deployment
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Wait for "Building..." to finish
3. Wait for "Deploying..." to finish
4. Look for "✅ Ready" status

### Test the Application
1. Go to https://frontend-two-swart-31.vercel.app
2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
3. Login with admin credentials
4. Open browser console (F12)
5. Navigate around the app
6. Check console for errors

### Expected Results
```
✅ Login successful (200 OK)
✅ GET /api/admin/orders - 200 OK
✅ GET /api/team/my-entities - 200 OK
✅ GET /api/notifications - 200 OK
✅ No 500 errors
✅ No 404 errors
✅ No build errors
```

## 📝 Environment Variables Needed

Make sure these are set in Vercel:

1. ✅ **DATABASE_URL** - PostgreSQL connection string (you have this)
2. ✅ **JWT_SECRET** - JWT signing secret
3. ✅ **JWT_REFRESH_SECRET** - JWT refresh token secret
4. ⚠️ **SUPABASE_URL** - (Optional now, not used by admin/orders anymore)
5. ⚠️ **SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY** - (Optional now, not used by admin/orders anymore)

The admin/orders endpoint now only needs `DATABASE_URL` and `JWT_SECRET`.

## 🎯 Next Steps

### After Successful Deployment
1. Test the application
2. Verify no console errors
3. Move to critical Week 1 tasks:
   - Sentry error tracking (2h)
   - Email templates (4h)
   - PostHog analytics (2h)

### If Still Issues
1. Check Vercel deployment logs
2. Check browser console for specific errors
3. Verify DATABASE_URL is correct
4. Verify JWT_SECRET is set
