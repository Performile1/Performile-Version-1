## üîç ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Likely Causes (Strawberry Browser Specific)
1. **JavaScript Compatibility:** Strawberry Browser may not support certain ES6+ features used in the React app
2. **Polyfills Missing:** Missing polyfills for modern JavaScript features
3. **Browser Detection:** Application may be blocking or failing on unrecognized browsers
4. **API/CORS Issues:** Different CORS handling in Strawberry Browser
5. **LocalStorage/Cookies:** Different storage implementation causing initialization failure

### Recommendation
**Primary:** Test and develop using **Chrome** (confirmed working)  
**Secondary:** Add browser compatibility checks and polyfills for broader support

## ‚úÖ MERCHANT ROLE AUDIT (Chrome Browser)

**Status:** Audit needs to be re-run in Chrome to document actual functionality

### Next Steps
1. Re-run audit using Chrome browser
2. Document all working features
3. Test all CRUD operations
4. Record any errors/issues found
5. Complete the FRONTEND_AUDIT_TEMPLATE.md
