# üìä Audit Summary - October 14, 2025

## QUICK OVERVIEW

**Platform Health: 78/100** üü°  
**Production Ready: 85%**  
**Critical Issues: 3**  
**Action Required: Yes**

---

## KEY FINDINGS

### ‚úÖ Strengths
1. Core features working (Orders, Auth, Dashboard, TrustScore)
2. RLS policies enabled on orders table
3. Secure authentication (JWT, bcrypt)
4. Good database design
5. Modern tech stack

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Weaknesses
1. **Zero test coverage** (0%)
2. **Data leakage risk** (RLS needs testing)
3. **High code duplication** (75+ files create own DB pool)
4. **Inconsistent patterns** (error handling, types)
5. **No automated security checks**

### üî¥ Critical Issues
1. SessionExpiredModal render error
2. No automated tests
3. RLS policies not comprehensively tested

---

## DOCUMENTS CREATED

1. **AUDIT_OCT_14_2025.md** - Full audit report
2. **TESTING_STRATEGY.md** - Testing plan (70% coverage goal)
3. **DATA_LEAKAGE_PREVENTION.md** - Security testing plan
4. **PROJECT_CONSTITUTION.md** - Code standards & governance

---

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Week 1)

### Priority 1: Security
- [ ] Test all RLS policies with each role
- [ ] Verify no data leakage between roles
- [ ] Document test results
- [ ] Fix any issues found

### Priority 2: Testing
- [ ] Install Jest, RTL, Playwright
- [ ] Setup test infrastructure
- [ ] Write first 10 critical tests
- [ ] Setup CI/CD with tests

### Priority 3: Bug Fixes
- [ ] Fix SessionExpiredModal render error
- [ ] Fix 401 authentication errors
- [ ] Implement missing endpoints

---

## DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP

### Sprint 1 (Week 1-2): Critical Fixes
- Fix render errors
- RLS comprehensive testing
- Setup automated tests
- Fix 401 errors
- **Goal:** 30% test coverage

### Sprint 2 (Week 3-4): Features
- Complete subscription limits
- Missing endpoints
- Notification system
- **Goal:** 50% test coverage

### Sprint 3 (Week 5-6): Quality
- Reduce code duplication
- Standardize patterns
- Improve error handling
- **Goal:** 70% test coverage

### Sprint 4 (Week 7-8): Performance
- Implement caching
- Optimize queries
- Security audit
- **Goal:** Production ready

---

## CODE QUALITY ISSUES

### High Priority
1. **DB Pool Management** (75+ files)
   - Centralize pool creation
   - Implement connection monitoring
   - Add automatic cleanup

2. **RLS Context** (Inconsistent)
   - Standardize on `withRLS()` helper
   - Audit all endpoints
   - Add middleware

3. **Auth Middleware** (Duplicated 50+ times)
   - Create reusable middleware
   - Apply to all protected routes

### Medium Priority
1. **Error Handling** (Inconsistent)
2. **TypeScript Types** (Too many `any`)
3. **SQL Queries** (Mix of patterns)

---

## DATA LEAKAGE RISKS

### Critical Tests Needed

**Orders Table:**
```sql
-- Merchant should see only own stores
SET app.user_role = 'merchant';
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders; -- Verify result

-- Courier should see only assigned
SET app.user_role = 'courier';
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders; -- Verify result

-- Consumer should see only own email
SET app.user_role = 'consumer';
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders; -- Verify result
```

**Subscription Limits:**
```bash
# Test creating order beyond limit
# Expected: 403 with upgrade message
```

**API Authorization:**
```bash
# Test accessing admin endpoint as merchant
# Expected: 403 Forbidden
```

---

## BEST PRACTICES COMPLIANCE

### Following ‚úÖ
- Parameterized SQL queries
- Password hashing
- JWT authentication
- RLS policies
- Git version control
- Environment variables

### Not Following ‚ùå
- No automated tests
- Inconsistent error handling
- High code duplication
- No rate limiting
- No CSRF protection
- Incomplete documentation
- No security headers
