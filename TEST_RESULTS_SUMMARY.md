## 🔍 Analysis

### ✅ What Worked
- **6 tests passed** - This confirms:
  - ✅ Test users were created successfully
  - ✅ Database connection is working
  - ✅ Basic test infrastructure is functional
  - ✅ Some core functionality is working

### ❌ Why Most Tests Failed

The **312 failed tests** are likely due to:

1. **Application Not Running**
   - Tests expect the app to be running at `http://localhost:3000` or similar
   - Most failures are probably timeouts waiting for pages to load

2. **Environment Variables Missing**
   - Database connection strings
   - API keys
   - Supabase configuration

3. **Backend Not Running**
   - API endpoints not responding
   - Database queries failing

4. **Test Data Issues**
   - Some tests may need additional test data beyond the 2 users we created
   - Missing stores, orders, or other entities
